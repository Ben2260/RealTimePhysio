# RealTimePhysio
### Description
> This REPO serves as a conglomeration of 2 projects:
> 1."Enabling of Realtime analysis of human physiological features"
> 2. "Connecting Simulink and Matlab efficiently to LSL"
> These two projects were developed during my time at the University of Colorado Boulder's Bioastronautics Laboratory.
> #### Project 1: Enabling of Realtime analysis of human physiological features
>>
>> This section will be filled out at a later date and after approval has been given.
>>
> #### Project 2: Connecting Simulink and Matlab efficiently to LSL
>> This process leverages the existing Lab Streaming Layer system and framework to establish a methodology for catching signals generated within a Simulink or Matlab environment. The basic structure provided uses a Python process as a middle man for processing the signal.
