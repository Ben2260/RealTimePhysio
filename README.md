# RealTimePhysio
### Description
> This REPO serves as a conglomeration of 2 projects:
> 1."Enabling of Realtime analysis of human physiological features"
> 2. "Connecting Simulink and Matlab efficiently to LSL"
> These two projects were developed during my time at the University of Colorado Boulder's Bioastronautics Laboratory.
> #### $${\color{White}Project \space 1: \space Enabling \space of \space Realtime \space analysis \space of \space human \space physiological \space features}$$

> #### $${\color{White}Project \space 2: \space Connecting \space Simulink \space and \space Matlab \space efficiently \space to \space LSL}$$ 
>> This process leverages the existing Lab Streaming Layer system and framework to establish a methodology for catching signals generated within a Simulink or Matlab environment. The basic structure provided uses a Python process as a middle man for processing the signal.
